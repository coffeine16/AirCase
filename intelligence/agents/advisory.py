"""Citizen Health Risk Advisory Agent — Node 6.

Ward-level health advisories: forecast AQI x population vulnerability -> a risk tier
and a plain-language advisory in the citizen's own language.

THE RULES THIS FOLLOWS (same discipline as every other agent here)

1. THE HEALTH CATEGORY IS DETERMINISTIC. The AQI band comes from the official CPCB
   NAQI breakpoints and the risk tier is plain arithmetic over (band, vulnerability).
   An LLM never decides how dangerous the air is. It may only phrase what the
   arithmetic already concluded.

2. THE FALLBACK MUST SPEAK THE LANGUAGES TOO. "Language coverage" that evaporates
   when GEMINI_API_KEY is missing is not coverage. So every language ships a
   rule-based template, and the LLM is a *nicety* that makes the prose warmer — not
   the thing that makes it exist.

3. THE ENGLISH IS NOT INVENTED. The health-impact wording is CPCB's own published
   NAQI advisory text per band. We are not qualified to write original medical advice
   and we do not; we route the official line to the right ward at the right time.

⚠️ VERIFICATION IS PER LANGUAGE, IT RECORDS THE METHOD, AND IT SHIPS IN THE OUTPUT.
Shipping health advice nobody on the team can read is exactly the confident-but-
unverified claim this project keeps deleting. So each language carries HOW it was
verified (see VERIFICATION), not merely whether:

    en  cpcb_official  — CPCB's own published NAQI wording. Not our words.
    hi  native_speaker — a Hindi speaker rejected the first draft as too formal; the
                         register was rewritten to everyday speech.
    ta  native_speaker — the team's native Tamil speaker approved it unchanged.
    kn  cross_checked  — nobody here reads Kannada. Machine-written, then rewritten
                         and cross-checked term-for-term against the corrections a
                         HUMAN made to the Hindi.

`cross_checked` is deliberately not `native_speaker`, and the disclaimer says so on
every Kannada advisory. A second model agreeing with the first is evidence of
CONSISTENCY, not of correctness. That distinction is the whole point of the field.

WHAT WE CAN AND CANNOT SEE FOR VULNERABILITY
The brief asks for "hospitals, schools, outdoor workers, elderly populations".
  schools + hospitals  -> we have them (OSM, `lu_sensitive`)
  outdoor workers      -> no free national dataset; NOT modelled
  elderly              -> needs Census ward-level age data; NOT modelled
We report the two we can measure and say so, rather than inventing a proxy.
